## Example Voting App Kubernetes - ***** NodePort ******* - therefore it's for local kubernetes clusters like minikube etc, not for cloud - as for cloud we would need loadbalancer.
This has been fixed in kubernetes-example-voting-app - https://github.com/ashu-89/kubernetes-example-voting-app/blob/master/result-app-service.yml 

This is based on the original [example-voting-app](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app) repository from the [docker-examples](https://github.com/dockersamples) GitHub page

and modified it to work on the Kubernetes cluster.
